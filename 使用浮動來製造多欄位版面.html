<h1>The Evolution of Bicycle</h1>
<div class="column1of3">
    <h3>The First Bicycle</h3>
        <p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking
            machine that would help him get around
             the royal gardnes faster.</p>
        <p>The device know as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse")
         was made of wood, and propelled by pushing your
         feed on the ground in gilding movement.</p>
        <p>It was not seen a suitable for any place
         other than a well maintained pathway.</p>

    <h3>Further Innovations</h3>
        <p>In 1865, the velocipede (missing "fast foot")
         attached pedals to the front wheel, but its
         wooden structure mad it extremely uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared.
         The pedals were attached directly to the front wheel.</p>
        <p>Solid rubber tired and the long spokes of the large front wheel
         provided a much smoother ride than is predecessor.</p>
