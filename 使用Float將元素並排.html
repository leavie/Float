<h1>The Evolution of bicycle</h1>
<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking
    machine that would help him get around
     the royal gardnes faster.</p>
<p>The device know as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse")
 was made of wood, and propelled by pushing your
 feed on the ground in gilding movement.</p>
<p>It was not seen a suitable for any place
 other than a well maintained pathway.</p>
<p>In 1865, the velocipede (missing "fast foot")
 attached pedals to the front wheel, but its
 wooden structure mad it extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared.
 The pedals were attached directly to the front wheel.</p>
<p>Solid rubber tired and the long spokes of the large front wheel
 provided a much smoother ride than is predecessor.</p>
